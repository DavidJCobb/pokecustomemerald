# Scrollbar

A tile-based widget that displays a scrollbar with a proportional thumb &mdash; that is, the size of the scrollbar thumb will vary in proportion to how much of the content you can see at once.

Scrollbar coordinates must be tile-aligned. The visible scrollbar will render within the center of its assigned strip of on-screen tiles. Scrollbars need at most 4 tile IDs, though what these IDs are used for varies depending on the position of the scrollbar thumb.
