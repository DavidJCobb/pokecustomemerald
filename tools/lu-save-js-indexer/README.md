This post-build script dumps specific groups of preprocessor macro definitions from the game's source code (using `gcc -E`), and then analyzes those definitions in order to generate *extra-data files* for use by the JS-based save editor (`lu-save-js`). We attempt to resolve each macro's `#define`d value to an integer constant and, if successful, we store that value and use it both in future substitutions (within other macros) and, in specific cases, as output to the extra-data files.

The goal is to generate a space-optimized (and therefore bandwidth-optimized) collection of data for `lu-save-js` to use for displaying game data, in order to avoid having to hardcode that data into `lu-save-js` itself. For example, rather than hardcoding the names of all game items into the save editor, an extra-data file can be generated which lists all of the `ITEM_` constants from `include/constants/item.h`.

Extra-data files apply to a particular savedata serialization version (i.e. the `SAVEDATA_SERIALIZATION_VERSION` macro in the modified savedata system). For a given version <var>n</var>, they are stored in <code>lu-save-js/formats/<var>n</var>/</code>, using the <code>.dat</code> file extension.

The core post-build logic is stored in this folder, but additional support files are present in `lu-lua-lib`.

## Support libraries

As mentioned, various support libraries are stored in `tools/lu-lua-lib`. I may move them to this folder later.

* **`classes.lua`:** Defines a `make_class` function that can be used to create classes with constructors, single inheritance, and static and instance members. See code comments inside for documentation.

* **`console.lua`:** Not yet used. A singleton that aids with printing output to the console, assuming support for ANSI escape codes.

* **`dataview.lua`:** An analogue to JavaScript's `DataView` class, allowing one to work with sequences of bytes and output them to a file.

* **`shell.lua`:** A wrapper around `os.exec` and similar commands, to make it easier to invoke shell commands.

* **`stdext.lua`:** Extensions to Lua's standard library.

* **`stringify-table.lua`:** Functions to stringify and print the contents of a table. See code comments inside for documentation.

These files are included from `main.lua`.

## Processing macros

Most macros are simple integers, e.g. `#define foo 1`. However, many macros are expressions which produce integer constants, e.g. `#define bar (foo + 3)`. We wish to be able to resolve the latter category of macros to their integer values.

To facilitate this, the Lua library files include a C lexer and expression parser, and a function which attempts to treat a C AST node as an expression tree and compute an integer constant. The parser is based on [the C standard as it existed in a 2007 draft](https://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG14/www/docs/n1256.pdf) (see section 6.5). Full parsing of all syntactic elements is not implemented: for example, any non-whitespace character sequence that doesn't match a known symbol is assumed to be an identifier regardless of whether it'd be a valid identifier in C; and typenames are parsed as single identifiers, so `struct Foo` would fail to parse. The parser is best-effort, designed to handle the specific needs of this post-build script; if any macro's value fails to parse, then we assume that it's "real code" and not just a constant value, and we skip loading the macro.

Relevant files:

* `tools/lu-lua-lib/c-ast.lua`
* `tools/lu-lua-lib/c-lex.lua`
* `tools/lu-lua-lib/c-parser.lua`
* `tools/lu-lua-lib/c-exec-integer-constant-expression.lua`


## Extra-data file format

Extra-data files are little-endian binary blobs divided into *subrecords*. Each subrecord has a header prefixing its data:

| Offset | Size | Field | Description |
| -: | -: | :- | :- |
| 0 | 8 | Signature | An eight-CC which identifies the subrecord type. |
| 8 | 4 | Version | The version number. If changes are made to a given subrecord's format, this version number can be used to allow newer readers to tell old-format and new-format subrecords apart. |
| 12 | 4 | Size | The size of the subrecord data, not including the size of this header. |
| 16 | | Data | The subrecord data. Format varies based on the signature. |

### Subrecords

#### `ENUMDATA`

Describes an enumeration that may be of interest to the save editor. The precise format of the data varies depending on whether the enumeration is sparse or contiguous. The basics are that the enum is assumed to have a name prefix shared by all of its members, and that the unprefixed member names are stored in a single block, with sparse enums having all of the values in a block after that.

The start of the subrecord body is always the same (offsets are relative to the start of the subrecord body, not the start of the entire subrecord):

| Offset | Size | Field | Description |
| -: | -: | :- | :- |
| 0 | 1 | Flags | Bit 0 indicates whether this enumeration's values are signed. Bit 1 indicates whether the enumeration is sparse. Bit 2 indicates whether the enumeration's lowest value is non-zero. |
| 1 | 1 | Prefix length | The length of the prefix string. |
| 2 | \* | Prefix string | A sequence of 8-bit ASCII characters: a prefix that applies to all enumeration members. The text is not null-terminated. |
| \* | 4 | Count | The number of members in the enumeration. |

Data after this point varies depending on the enumeration's flags.

* If the enumeration is contiguous and the lowest value is non-zero, then read a 4-byte value and let that be *Lowest*. Otherwise, let *Lowest* be zero.
* If the enumeration is contiguous, then let *NameBlock* be the rest of the subrecord. Otherwise, read a 4-byte unsigned integer *NameBlockSize*: *NameBlock* encompasses the next *NameBlockSize* bytes of the subrecord.
* Read *NameBlock* as a buffer of 8-bit ASCII characters. This block consists of all of the enumeration members' names with the enum's prefix removed, separated with a single null byte. They are not specifically null-terminated: the last name is not followed by a null byte.
  * If the number of names in *NameBlock* does not equal the *Count* value read previously, then the subrecord is ill-formed.
  * If the enumeration is contiguous, then *NameBlock* is sorted in ascending order by value, such that the *n*-th name refers to value *Lowest* + *n*. There is no more data to read.
* If the enumeration is sparse, then let *ValueBlock* be the rest of the subrecord. This block consists of *Count* 4-byte integer values, such that the *n*-th name in *NameBlock* refers to the *n*-th value in *ValueBlock*.

As an example, the `NATURES` enum from the vanilla game is encoded as:

```hex

```

Observe the following details:

* The flags byte, here located at offset 0x10, is 0x00. The enum is unsigned, contiguous, and starts at zero.
* The prefix is a length-prefixed string with a single-byte prefix: 0x07; ergo the next seven bytes, `NATURE_`, are the prefix.
* There are 0x19 (24) enum members.
* Each enum member name is serialized without its prefix; so `NATURE_HARDY` is serialized as just `HARDY`.
* There is no null byte after `QUIRKY`, because the names are null-*separated*, not null-*terminated*.

The format is such that you can rapidly extract all enum names in JavaScript by spawning a `TextDecoder`, calling its `decode` method on a `DataView` consisting only of *NameBlock*, and then calling `split("\0")` on the result.

#### `VARIABLS`

Describes individual macros whose values are integer constants. The subrecord consists of zero or more repetitions of the following structure (offsets are relative to the start of the subrecord body, not the start of the entire subrecord):

| Offset | Size | Field | Description |
| -: | -: | :- | :- |
| 0 | 2 | *NameSize* | The number of bytes that make up the macro's name. |
| 2 | *NameSize* | Name | A sequence of 8-bit ASCII characters. No null terminator. |
| 2 + *NameSize* | 1 | Flags | Bit 0 indicates that the value is signed. |
| 3 + *NameSize* | 4 | Value | The macro's four-byte integer value. |
