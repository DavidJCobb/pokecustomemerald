This tool is intended to be a web-based utility for dumping the contents of a savegame, given the `.sav` file and the `.xml` file (generated by the `lu_bitpack` compiler plug-in) which describes the bitpacked file format.

The architecture is as follows:

* Elements of the save file format
  * `CStruct` and `CUnion` map to XML elements in `c-types`; in essence, they are struct and union definitions.
  * `CValue` maps to `decl_descriptor`s in the plug-in; in essence, they are variables and struct/union members. A single `CValue` may describe a single serialized value or a serialized array.
* Elements of an actual save file, as represented in JS
  * `CStructInstance` and `CUnionInstance` are instances of structs and unions.
  * `CValueInstance` is a serialized value.
    * Currently, `CValueInstance` is a direct parallel to `CValue`, but this complicates the handling of arrays. I will likely split it into `CValueInstance` for single values and `CValueInstanceArray` for arrays, such that `int foo[3][2]` in C produces one `CValue`, and nested `CValueInstanceArray`s where the innermost ones hold multipel `CValue`s.
